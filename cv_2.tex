\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}

{\bf OzGrav, Swinburne University of Technology} \hfill March 2019 - Present \\
{\sl Visiting Student Intern} \\
Supervisor: Prof. Matthew Bailes
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Pipeline of Full Time Resolution Recovery for Localized ASKAP FRBs.}\\
The work is continued from the previous project from CIRA. I am working on refining the reconstruction process for FRB180924 for more accurate results, and will generalize this process to a pipeline applicable for any localized ASKAP FRBs. FRB181112 will also be reconstructed for high resolution time domain FRB science. \\
{\sl Population Analysis for Radio Telescopes.}\\
Work in progress.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy (CIRA)} \hfill December 2018 - February 2019 \\
{\sl Visiting Research Associate / Summer Studentship} \\
Supervisor: Dr. Clancy James, Professor Jean-Pierre Macquart
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Recovering the Full Time Resolution of ASKAP FRB Voltage Data.}\\
As a member of The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (\href{http://astronomy.curtin.edu.au/research/craft/}{CRAFT}) team, I worked on inverting channelization of voltage data to retrieve its full time resolution. ASKAP's high time-resolved voltage data enables quantum optical analysis of FRBs. This new diagnosis of FRBs is expected to reveal information about the source's emission properties, and thus help solve the mystery of its origin. I took voltage data from ASKAP and recovered its full time resolution via off-line processing. In particular, I used ASKAP's first localized FRB180924, but this process will be applicable to all ASKAP's localized FRBs. Most of my work was done with Python to coherently sum signals from antennas, invert the channelization (PFB), and coherently de-disperse.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf Caltech Theoretical Astrophysics} \hfill June 2018 - August 2018 \\
{\sl Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow} \\
Supervisor: Professor Sterl Phinney
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Numerical Modeling of Time-Independent Accretion Discs with Instabilities.}\\
I wrote from scratch Python code that solves the time-independent accretion disc equations numerically. These included OPAL and Ferguson opacities, equations of state, and treatment of convection. The purpose of the project was to make realistic and general models of accretion discs covering all parameter space from Cataclysmic Variables to Active Galactic Nuclei and to investigate instabilities caused by the onset of convection and hydrogen recombination.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf GIST General Intelligence and Smart Environment Laboratory}\\
{\sl Student Intern} \hfill October 2015 - August 2017 \\
Supervisor: Professor Kin Choong Yow
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Studying Deep Learning and its applications to physics problem.}\\
I worked on a project to derive physical formulas from data by modifying Google's TensorFlow Python code.
\end{itemize}
