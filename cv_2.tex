\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}

{\bf OzGrav, Swinburne University of Technology} \hfill March 2019 - June 2019 \\
{\sl Visiting Student Intern} \\
Supervisors: Prof. Matthew Bailes, Prof. Adam Deller, Dr. Ryan Shannon
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl High Time Resolution Voltage Data and their Analysis of Localized ASKAP FRBs.}\\
The work is continued from the previous project from CIRA. I worked on improving the pipeline of recovering full time resolution of localized ASKAP FRB voltage data. I have generalized this pipeline for any localized sources for ASKAP, and tested the pipeline. I recovered the full time resolution ($\sim 3~\mathrm{ns}$) for three ASKAP localized FRBs: FRB180924, FRB181112, and FRB190102. Not only have I recovered the full time resolution of the three FRBs, but I have also done some analysis on the high time resolution data. I have modeled FRB180924 pulse to measure its rising time and scattering time, and I have polarization calibrated and analyzed FRB181112. For FRB190102, the polarization calibration and analysis is still in progress. % \\
%{\sl Population Analysis for Radio Telescopes.}\\
%Work in progress.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy (CIRA)} \hfill December 2018 - February 2019 \\
{\sl Visiting Research Associate / Summer Studentship} \\
Supervisors: Prof. Jean-Pierre Macquart, Dr. Clancy James
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Recovering the Full Time Resolution of ASKAP FRB Voltage Data.}\\
As a member of The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (\href{http://astronomy.curtin.edu.au/research/craft/}{CRAFT}) collaboration, I worked on inverting channelization of voltage data to retrieve its full time resolution. ASKAP's high time-resolved voltage data enables quantum optical analysis of FRBs. This new diagnosis of FRBs is expected to reveal information about the source's emission properties, and thus help solve the mystery of its origin. I took voltage data from ASKAP and recovered its full time resolution as an off-line processing. In particular, I used ASKAP's first localized FRB180924 to start with, but this process will be applicable to all ASKAP's localized FRBs. Most of my work was done with Python to coherently sum signals from antennas, invert the channelization (PFB), and coherently de-disperse.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf Caltech Theoretical Astrophysics} \hfill June 2018 - August 2018 \\
{\sl Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow} \\
Supervisor: Prof. Sterl Phinney
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Numerical Modeling of Time-Independent Accretion Discs with Instabilities.}\\
I wrote Python scripts from scratch that solves the time-independent accretion disc equations numerically. These included OPAL and Ferguson opacities, equations of state, and treatment of convection. The purpose of the project was to make realistic and general models of accretion discs covering all parameter space from Cataclysmic Variables to Active Galactic Nuclei and to investigate instabilities caused by the onset of convection and hydrogen recombination.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf GIST General Intelligence and Smart Environment Laboratory}\\
{\sl Student Intern} \hfill October 2015 - August 2017 \\
Supervisor: Prof. Kin Choong Yow
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\sl Studying Deep Learning and its applications to physics problem.}\\
I learned object oriented programming with C\texttt{++}, and deep learning with Google's Tensorflow. Also, I worked on a project to derive physical formulae from data based on Google's TensorFlow Python scripts.
\end{itemize}
